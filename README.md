# CODSOFT Internship – Data Science

This repository contains all tasks and projects completed as part of my internship at CodSoft.
The work focuses on applying data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Project Title
**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

---

## Project Description
Credit card fraud detection is a critical problem due to the highly imbalanced nature of transaction data.
In this project, machine learning models are used to identify fraudulent transactions by learning patterns
from historical transaction data.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature handling, model training,
and performance evaluation using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and handle imbalanced datasets
- Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Build and evaluate machine learning classification models
- Use suitable evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Gain practical experience with real-world financial data

---

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **not uploaded** to the repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

**Dataset Source:**  
Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)

To run the project:
1. Download the dataset from the official source.
2. Place the CSV file in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Model Evaluation
Due to class imbalance, model performance is evaluated using:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide a more reliable assessment than accuracy alone.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world fraud detection problem.
It highlights the importance of proper data handling, model evaluation, and ethical use of financial data.

## Disclaimer
This project was developed solely for educational and internship purposes as part of the CodSoft Internship Program.
All implementations are original and created for learning objectives.
